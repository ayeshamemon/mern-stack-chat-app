# mern-stack-chat-app
This is a Real Time Chat Application.
I have implemented real time chats using web sockets.
Before  entering into the main chat application the application needs authentication.
For that i have made Login Page and Register Page.
The passwords of the users are encrypted before the data is stored in DB.
All the users data and chats data is saved into the database.
In this project i have also integrated real time video calling feature.
For the video calling feature i have used WebRTC. I have used the Simple Peer library.

Technologies Used Are: Node, React & MongoDB.

The output of the code with screenshots is in the output folder.
